Clear instructions within the README of how to run the code
-Ensure you have a C++ compiler, eg gcc or g++
-In VSCode run the code using the "play button" at the top write.
-The same commands that were taken from the project doc are there, even the ones that will throw errors.
-Uncomment certain commands if you want to simulate a get error.


Brief (3-5 sentences) write-up within the README of how this assignment should be modified in order to become an “official” assignment in the future (consider clarifications to the instructions, different methods that should be written, more effective ways to grade, or any other aspect!)
-I wasn't sure whether to have the code interactive within the terminal because the instructions did not indicate how the user will interact with the application.  I, instead, simply had the commands in main that will run them and add them to the database.
-In the future, it would be helpful to have instructions on how the UI should be. Also, this should be a 3 part assignment.  First part should be this way, with commands in terminal and then the next part should involve interacting with user input in the terminal.  The third part should be a simple ui that can be connected to the code and more professional looking.
